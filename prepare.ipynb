to become a software developer\\n \\nwhat were you doing before codeup\\neddy had been a sales assistant for years and was a student at san antonio college studying kinesiology\\nbridget worked at a

became an it specialist\\n \\nwhat led you to a career in coding\\nwhen someone he knew mentioned coding eddy learned all he could and coded for three days using online courses and tutorials he immediately knew this was what he wanted to do as a career \\nwhile bridget was working at the lawyers office a development team came in to help with court systems she asked them questions and became fascinated by what they were doing after deciding not to pursue law she decided to go back to school for it her job as an it specialist isnt exactly what she had in mind but her degree didnt offer the coding experience necessary to become a developer which was her true end goal even after moving to hawaii and having two kids that dream persisted her cousin a developer mentioned that some of her coworkers went to a coding bootcamp with another kid and another move on the horizon she decided she would enroll in a coding bootcamp when her family settled down in texas \\n \\nwhy codeup\\nwhile researching how to become a developer eddy found codeup our culture stood out to him the admissions team was helpful he liked that we offer help with the job search through resume assistance and interview training and he really liked how plugged in we are to the san antonio technology scene he felt all the pieces coming together and could picture himself here\\nfor bridget it boiled down to the curriculum and handson experience when she was in college she learned a lot of theory but didnt get experience actually coding which as she learned the hard way is what employers are really looking for she looked into some options for coding bootcamps and codeup stood out to her it was big plus that even as a military spouse she was able to use va benefits she loved our assistance with

she loves it so much she often works late unintentionally until her kids come in the room to check on her because of this she doesnt feel completely balanced but knows that its only because she loves it so much\\neddy feels similarly stating that when they do work late its usually because they want to the worklife balance has been good for him\\n \\nwhat advice would you give to someone thinking of attending codeups web development program\\nbridget was nervous coming into codeup but it gave her everything she was looking for part of why she wanted to be a developer was because she thought they get to sit around alone not having to interact with anybody she very quickly realized this was not the case you have to speak up and you have to do it well and often with a lot of people youll have to work hard beyond the regular hours take advantage of all the resources schedule some meetups with peers to work together outside of class its so worth it in the end just go for it\\neddy learned that keeping a parttime job is possible but really really hard he was one of the only students ever to finish codeup while working a job rushing to work right after class he regrets doing that because he missed out on socializing and working together after hours but when he had time he always tried to work with other students to solve problems together and encourages the same in others break out of your comfort zone and dont be scared to just start from where you are the first couple weeks will be really hard but learn to fall in love with the feeling of being stuck because eventually youll be able to solve it\\nbridget and eddy are working together at via but took very different pathways to get to where they are eddy hadnt thought much about coding before deciding to

Our culture stood out to him, the admission team wa helpful, he liked that we offer help with the job search through resume assistance and interview training, and he really liked how plugged in we are to the San Antonio technology scene. He felt all the piece coming together and could picture himself here. For Bridget, it boiled down to the curriculum and hands-on experience. When she wa in college, she learned a lot of theory, but didn’t get experience actually coding, which, a she learned the hard way, is what employer are really looking for. She looked into some option for coding bootcamps and Codeup stood out to her. It wa big plus that even a a military spouse, she wa able to use VA benefits. She loved our assistance with job placement, and noted that she had gone to school twice and neither college offered anything like that. What’s a typical day for you? Currently, both panelist are working a developer for VIA Metropolitan Transit. Due to COVID-19, they’re both working from home. Eddy usually start his day early with a coding challenge on a website like Codewars. He ha a virtual meeting with his mentor to discus some code. For most of the day, they solve a problem or do some pair programming. They also have team meeting and daily standups. Bridget is currently leading an Artificial Intelligence project with VIA that take up most of her time. She usually ha virtual meeting with member of her team, other team at VIA, and contractors. She doe documentation and us program to update the current status of her project for the team to see. How is the work-life balance? Coding is a hobby for Bridget. She take her laptop with her from room to room, sometimes coding with her child in her lap. She love it so much, she often work late unintentionally until her kid come in the room to check on her. Because of this, she doesn’t feel completely balanced but know that it’s only because she love it so much. Eddy feel similarly, stating that when they do work late, it’s usually because they want to. The work-life balance ha been good for him. What advice would you give to someone thinking of attending Codeup’s Web Development program? Bridget wa nervous coming into Codeup, but it gave her everything she wa looking for. Part of why she wanted to be a developer wa because she thought they get to sit around alone, not having to interact with anybody. She very quickly realized this wa not the case. “You have to speak up and you have to do it well, and often, with a lot of people. You’ll have to work hard, beyond the regular hours. Take advantage of all the resources. Schedule some meetups with peer to work together outside of class. It’s so worth it in the end. Just go for it!” Eddy learned that keeping a part-time job is possible but really, really hard. He wa one of the only student ever to finish Codeup while working a job, rushing to work right after class. He regret doing that because he missed out on socializing and working together after hours. But when he had time, he always tried to work with other student to solve problem together, and encourages the same in others. “Break out of your comfort zone and don’t be scared to just start from where you are. The first couple week will be really hard, but learn to fall in love with the feeling of being stuck, because eventually you’ll be able to solve it.” Bridget and Eddy are working together at VIA, but took very different pathway to get to where they are. Eddy hadn’t thought much about coding before deciding to dive right into it, whereas Bridget wanted a career a a developer for years. Whether coding is something you never gave much thought to or you’ve tried a different route before, you, too, can make a transition into web development with Codeup!

What Codeup? Eddy sales assistant years student San Antonio College studying Kinesiology. Bridget worked courthouse, career plans altered becoming military spouse moving.

When someone knew mentioned coding, Eddy learned could coded three days using online courses tutorials. He immediately knew wanted career. While Bridget working lawyer’s office, development team came help court systems. She asked questions became fascinated doing. After deciding pursue law, decided go back school IT. Her job IT Specialist isn’t exactly mind, degree didn’t offer coding experience necessary become developer, true end goal. Even moving Hawaii two kids, dream persisted. Her cousin, developer, mentioned coworkers went coding bootcamp. With another kid another move horizon, decided would enroll coding bootcamp family settled Texas. Why Codeup?
